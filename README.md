# GRAL/GRAMM Recommendation Guide<br>
Dispersion modelling in complex terrain and in situations with low wind speeds is still challenging. Nevertheless, air pollution has to be assessed in such environments.
It is therefore necessary to develop models and methods, which allow for such assessments with reasonable demands on computational times and with sensible accuracy.
This has been the motivation for the development of the Lagrangian dispersion model GRAL at the Graz University of Technology, Institute for Internal Combustion Engines and Thermodynamics, ever since 1999. <br>
Meanwhile the Governments of Vienna (starting in 2020), Tyrol (since 2014) and Styria (since 2006), Austria, are further developing the model. In 2019, the decision was made to publish GRAL as Open Source.<br>

The "Recommendation Guide" is a small part of the GRAL and GRAMM documentation with additional helpful hints and tips from experienced users. <br>
Further documentation can be found on the [GRAL Homepage](http://lampz.tugraz.at/~gral/), especially the document "Documentation of the Lagrangian Particle Model GRAL (Graz Lagrangian Model)" and the document "Documentation of the prognostic mesoscale model GRAMM (Graz Mesoscale Model)". These documents contain the description of the model physics and the validation and test cases.<br>

This repository is intended to be used for the exchange of experiences and advanced users are invited to contribute their recommendations to the document.
