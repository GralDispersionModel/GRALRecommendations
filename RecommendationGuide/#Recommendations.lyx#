This document presents recommended methods and settings for the atmospheric
 dispersion modelling system GRAL and the non-hydrostatic mesoscale wind-field
 model GRAMM.
 These recommendations are based on experience and insights gained during
 the quality assurance procedure (see the GRAL/GRAMM documentation reports)
 and practical applications.
 This document aims to help users to obtain reasonable results for a wide
 range of applications.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Sometimes unrealistically high concentrations occur at facades, probably
 because the reflexion and/or the well-mixed criterion are not treated well
 enough by the model.
 Thus, it is not recommended to use computed concentrations at facades of
 buildings/obstacles.
 At least one grid point shall be between the point of interest and the
 side wall of a building.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Due to the stepped resolution of terrain in GRAL simulations, stepped patterns
 may occur in the resulting concentration maps (see chapt.

Table

 lists ranges for roughness lengths per land-use type.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If running GRAL without GRAMM, one of these values representing the model
 domain may be input into the graphical user interface (GUI).
 When running GRAL in this way, the roughness length as defined in the GUI
 is used for the entire model domain.
 Even if buildings are taken explicitly into account in GRAL simulations,
 it is necessary to set a mean roughness length in such cases, except the
 option “Adaptive Roughness” is used.
 If GRAL is coupled with GRAMM, the user-defined land-use file and therefore
 spatially varying surface roughness lengths are imported from the GRAMM
 model.
 The prescribed roughness value in the GUI is not used in this case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the Adaptive Roughness option is used, the GUI roughness length defines
 the minimum surface roughness in the domain area, the specified Adatpive
 Roughness value defines the maximum surface roughness.
 The surface roughness is estimated based on buildings and vegetation areas.
 For vegetation with a height of up to 1 m, the height is interpreted as
 roughness length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optional file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RoughnessLengthsGral.dat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 overrules the adaptive surface roughness algorithm and the GRAMM rouhness
 and defines the spatially varying surface roughness based on the values
 defined in this file.
 This file must be an ESRI ASCii raster file and the file must match the
 flow field raster (cell number, cell size).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When running GRAMM, the user may create a CORINE-based land-use file containing
 spatially non-homogenous roughness lengths.
 If GRAMM is used with the Adaptive Roughness option, the Adaptive Roughness
 is only used if it is higher than the GRAMM Roughness.
 When coupling with GRAMM, the Adaptive Roughness option should be used
 carefully (small maximum values).

Determination of stability classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
It is recommended to use a slightly modified form of the solar radiation
 delta-T (SRDT) method described in US-EPA (2000) to compute stability classes
 A-G (1 - 7).
 The method uses the surface layer wind speed (measured at or near 10
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m) in combination with measurements of total solar radiation during the
 day and a low-level vertical temperature difference ∆T at night.
 In order to distinguish between ‘DAYTIME’ and ‘NIGHTTIME’, it is recommended
 to use a threshold for solar radiation of 20
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

W/m² (note that instruments sometimes have offsets, thus a threshold of
 0
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

W/m² is not recommended).
 Note that GRAL uses figures instead of letters to assign stability classes
 (i.e.
 A = 1,…,G = 7).

Mesoscale wind field simulations with GRAMM

General remarks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Currently, the standard procedure is as follows: a meteorological time series
 is classed as defined by the user.
 For each binned situation GRAMM calculates quasi steady-state solutions
 for the flow field.
 Using such simple meteorological input data for a mesoscale model means
 that large uncertainties in computed flow fields evolve due to unknown
 surface temperatures, soil temperatures, soil moisture distributions, snow
 cover, etc.
 For this reason, the following the following procedure is recommended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use an artificial wind rose (delivered with GRAMM) as meterological input
 (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 The artificial wind rose contains a variety of wind speed, wind direction
 and stability classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use a sufficient number of wind speed and wind direction classes.

 This function can be applied to any existing GRAMM wind field simulation.
 The procedure looks up every computed flow situation discriminating between
 stable, neutral, and convective conditions, and selects the best-fitting
 simulation for each classified meteorological situation.
 This function can be used for multiple meteorological observations at any
 location within the model domain.
 It enables the following modelling strategy: first, for a specific classificati
on scheme of wind speed, and -direction defined by the user, all theoretically
 possible situations are simulated, using an artificial, equally distributed
 wind rose.
 In a second step, these simulations are matched to any observational site
 within the model domain.
 Whenever new observations are available or a detailled evaluation is needed
 for a part of the model domain, these existing wind fields can again be
 matched and need not to be simulated again.

The match-to-observation functional should be the preferred method in most
 GRAMM applications as it has the potential to improve simulation results
 enormously.
 Note that as wind-fields change after the match, stability classes will
 do so, too.
 Based on our experience, it might happen in less complex terrain, that
 the frequencies of each stability class throughout the model domain will
 deviate substantially from observed ones.
 Setting the weighting factors for each station used in the match function
 to a very low value, e.g.
 0.05 instead of the default value 1, increases the influence of stability
 classes compared to wind direction and wind speed.
 Weighting factors >1 lower the influence of the stability classes and increase
 the weigthing of wind speed and wind direction.
 Using the latest GRAMM and GUI (20.01 or later) version, the vectorial optimizat
ion method is preferred.
\end_layout

Complex terrain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In the presence of complex terrain it is strongly recommended to apply GRAMM
 to get 3D wind fields as input for GRAL.
 GRAMM can take into account effects of drainage flows, slope winds, blocking-,
 channeling of flows, and re-circulation behind topographical elevations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
For regulatory purposes, GRAMM is driven by the same meteorological data
 as GRAL, i.e.
 a time series of wind speed, wind direction, and stability class at a certain
 height.
 It should be stressed that the interpretation of the meteorological input
 data depends on the size of the GRAMM modelling domain.
 Generally, the meteorological input data represents the so-called ‘large-scale
 forcing’, i.e.
 the forcing originating outside of the modelling domain.
 For instance, for areas ranging a few tens of kilometres, the large-scale
 forcing consists of synoptic-scale pressure systems and pressure gradients
 generated by for example, mountain ridges and their respective low-lands
 or between land surfaces and large water bodies.
 Typically, mountain-valley or land-see breeze systems have pressure gradients
 with length scales of more than 100 km.
 Therefore, if the model domain is larger than this, these pressure differences
 can be captured by the model.
 In this case, synoptic-scale pressure differences remain as the only large-scal
e force.

The

integration time

 should be set in dependence on the size of the modelling domain and the
 intended physical phenomena to be simulated.
 For instance, if one attempts to simulate local phenomena such as slope
 winds or flow channelling, an integration time of one hour will be sufficient
 in most applications.
 However, if a user wishes to simulate mountain-valley wind systems or land-sea
 breezes, the integration time needs to be higher as the characteristic
 time scale of these phenomena are larger.
 An integration time of about 3 - 4 hours may often be suitable.
 Further, it is highly recommended that when simulating mountain-valley
 and land-sea winds, that the ‘sunrise option’ in the GUI is selected.
 This option invokes a transient computation of the sun’s incoming radiation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
GRAMM adjusts the user-defined integration time in dependence on wind speed
 and stability in order to minimize the computational time.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Integration-times-[t]"

\end_inset

 provides an overview of the automatically adjusted integration times in
 GRAMM.
 As shown, when the sunrise option is selected by the user, the simulation
 time in convective conditions is always set to 6 hours regardless of the
 integration time chosen by the user.
 As already mentioned, the sunrise option should only be selected when simulatin
g mountain-valley or land-sea winds with very large model domains.
 In the case of stability classes 6 and 7, integration times in GRAMM are
 extended for low-wind-speed situations.
 In this model set-up cold-air drainage flows are expected to develop.

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In flat terrain, small forces introduced by the boundary conditions or numerical
 algorithms can have a large effect on simulated flow fields.
 Numerous tests (e.g.
 Wilhelm, 2017) have shown that the standard GRAMM set-up is not appropriate
 for simulations in very flat terrain.
 Therefore, the ‘flat terrain option’ is available in the GUI, where some
 settings in GRAMM are changed to better represent flat-terrain conditions.
 In particular, different boundary conditions at the lateral boundaries
 for momentum (homogenous von Neuman BC) is used.
 In addition, the numerical computation of air temperature and radiation
 is neglected.
 It is highly recommended to use the flat terrain option for the aforementioned
 modelling objectives.

Mass divergence may increase during the simulation causing it to be larger

Whenever GRAMM becomes numerically unstable, the computation core repeats
 the simulation with reduced maximum time steps and in the case of continuing
 instabilities, relaxation factors will be reduced.
 If the simulation is forced to repeat a weather situation (up to four attempts)
, the number right to the one indicating the weather situation is increased

In some cases, the user may require a small modelling domain.
 Consequently, drainage flows might be underestimated or not simulated at
 all.
 This is because some of the hilly terrain causing drainage flows may be
 located outside of the model domain.
 The ‘catabatic forcing’ option may help to obtain better representation
 of drainage flows in such situations.
 In addition, the catabatic forcing can save CPU time in order to represent
 catabatic processes with smaller integration times.
 If possible however, it is recommended that the model domain is selected
 large enough to contain all important terrain characteristics playing a
 role in the development of drainage flows instead of using the 'catabatic
 forcing' option.

Prognostic flow field model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
The microscale flow field model in GRAL is a fully prognostic, non-hydrostatic
 model that takes into account the effects of buildings on dispersion.
 Thus, it is a very powerful tool to simulate flow around obstacles.
 However, the model can also be prone to numerical instabilities due to
 the complex, iterative-solution algorithm applied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In order to resolve obstacles with some accuracy, it is recommended to use
 a horizontal grid resolution below 10
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m.
 Best results are seen with grid sizes in the range of 2 – 4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m.
 The vertical grid size for the first layer above ground should be in the
 range of 1 – 2
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m.
 Vertical grid spacing below 1 m may lead to numerical instabilities.
 In addition, it is recommended to use the online functionality of the GUI
 to inspect flow fields during the simulation process.
 Alternatively, the user can analyse the GRAL flow fields when available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Generally, it can be stated that numerical instabilities can be avoided
 in most cases by increasing the vertical grid spacing or by decreasing
 the horizontal resolution.
 From experience, cubic-like grid cells (i.e.
 horizontal and vertical grid spacing are more or less equal) appear to
 ensure best numerical stability of the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
In many cases, problems can be avoided by keeping the model domain boundaries
 free of any obstacles.
 It is highly recommended that no obstacles are placed near the boundaries
 of the model within an area of approximately 10 times the horizontal grid
 size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
As GRAL has been thoroughly tested with the below set of parameter values
 prescribed in the GUI, it is not recommended to change these, as the model

There are several ways for detecting numerical instabilities: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Once GRAL is launched, the user can inspect the numerical values printed

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 If these figures increase, then numerical instability is very likely, and
 one of the remedies as described above should be tried out.
 
\end_layout

Another way is to use the online functionality of the GUI, which allows
 for inspecting simulated flow fields every time step of the simulation.

In some cases, it may be of interest for users to retrieve information about
 the simulated microscale flow field.
 For instance, simulated wind speeds behind walls may be needed to compute

As outlined in the GRAL manual, once receptor points are defined by the
 user, the time series of simulated flows at these receptor points is stored
 in the file named ‘GRAL_*NameOfReceptorPoint*.met’.

When running the model using the diagnostic option, the microscale flow
 around obstacles is computed on the bases of mass conservation only.
 GRAL evaluations clearly indicate that this approach is inferior to the
 prognostic option.
 Thus, it is not recommended to use this approach unless the size of the
 model domain prohibits the use of the prognostic flow field model or the
 prognostic model cannot be operated to get numerically stable results.

Due to the turbulence parameterisations used in the model it is not recommended

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Due to the nature of Lagrangian particle models, computed pollutant concentratio
ns are prone to a sampling error.
 This error can be kept small when the number of particles is set high enough.
 A rough guide can be found in the user manual of the graphical user interface.
 However, it is recommended that the user checks the file ‘Logfile_GRALCore.txt’,
 which can be found the folder directory where GRAL has been launched.
 In the case of large model domains with a large numbers of sources, there
 may not be enough particles defined by the user to adequately represent
 all sources in the simulation.
 In these cases, GRAL automatically increases the number of released particles.
 However, if the total number of particles (as documented in the logfile)
 is more than 20 % higher than initially defined by the user, it is highly
 recommended to increase the total number of particles in the simulations
 and to re-run the simulations from the beginning.
 The following table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Particlenumber"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 lists the minimum number of particles that are automatically assigned by
 GRAL, if the total initial number of particles is too low.
 As of GRAL version 20.01 a file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Receptor_Timeseries_Transient.txt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is written at the end of a calculation.
 This file contains the estimated statistical error for each receptor point
 in the last line.
 High error values indicate that too few particles were used in the simulation.
 A value NA (not available) means that no concentration at this receptor
 (no particle) has been counted.

If terrain needs to be taken into account, GRAMM simulations must first

 These simulations – due to computational reasons – can generally be performed
 with a rather coarse horizontal resolution (e.g.

 For some applications, however, it might be necessary to capture important

 This can be achieved through the GUI, and by running GRAL after the GRAMM
 simulations have been completed.
 This approach is explained below.

Due to the ‘stepped’ sides of the stone quarry, recirculation zones and
 rather complex microscale flow patterns would probably occur.
 Thus, invoking the prognostic microscale flow field model in GRAL was the
 preferred choice and was included in Test 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the prognostic option can only be invoked in the presence of buildings,
 which are not of interest in this case, a work-around is necessary to force
 GRAL to perform microscale flow simulations around the stone quarry.
 Up to the GRAL version 20.01, a single building could be placed in the GRAL
 model domain with a height of 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m (indicated by the black rectangle in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Test-3"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 Clearly, such a low building has no effect on the flow itself, but simply
 invokes the prognostic flow model of GRAL in the area, where the building
 is placed.
 This resulted in complex flow fields within the quarry, as shown in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Since the roughness of the ground may be changed by such a building, this
 method is no longer recommended!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather, as of version 20.01, a large sub-domain factor up to 1000 can be
 selected to force GRAL to calculate a large area prognostically.
 If you simply enter a building with a height of 2
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m and a sub domain factor of 1000, a surrounding area of 2000
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

The corresponding concentration map is shown in Figure

\end_inset

.
 Note, that the microscale flow field model in GRAL uses the roughness length
 of the building, so it may be necessary to adjust this value in the ‘GRAL
 Settings’ screen to represent the conditions of the area of interest.
 It is noted that simulation times increased in this case by about a factor
 of 10 relative to Tests 1 and 2.

This problem can be mitigated in the GRAL configuration using the following
 approaches:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Avoiding setting the concentration grids at a height close to the ground.
 For example, in the ‘GRAL Settings’ screen, ensure that the first ‘heights
 above ground’ value is set to 2
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m or higher.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Increasing the vertical dimension of concentration layers (in the ‘GRAL
 Settings’ tab).
 This will create a smoothing effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Reducing the vertical grid size of the microscale flow-field grid (e.g.
 setting the vertical thickness of the first layer to 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m and using a low vertical stretching factor (e.g.
 1.0).
 With the new ‘Flexible stretching factor’ functionality, acceptable computing
 times can be maintained using small stretching factors for low heights
 and higher factors for greater heights above the ground
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Setting the horizontal grid resolution of the GRAL concentration grid to
 be larger (e.g.
 twice as much) than the horizontal grid resolution of the GRAL internal
 flow-field grid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
Using one or more of the above approaches should result in a smoothing of
 the stepped concentration patterns.
 When visualising contours in the GUI, it is recommended that the low-pass
 filter option for concentration maps is applied.
 This option is available in the GUI ‘Layout Manager’ for contour maps and
 should be activated by default.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another (additional) option is to use the function ‘Low pass filter GRAL
 topography’ (and to save the filtered terrain afterwards) before the calculatio
n is started.
 This smoothes the terrain and helps to avoid isolated holes in the topography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is generally advised that, when using terrain and evaluating concentration
 layers, the height of evaluation should be above the value set for ‘Vertical
 thickness of first layer’.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Dispersion calculation for high stack sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Especially for dispersion calculations with high stacks, special attention
 must be paid to a sufficient number of particles.
 Otherwise, unrealistic concentration fields with strong concentration fluctuati
ons can occur near the ground.
 If you ask what defines a high stack: it depends - on the height, the exit
 velocity and the exit temperature of the exhaust gases and the distance
 to the receptor points.
 The higher the stack compared to the distance to the receptor points, the
 more important is the number of particles.
 From a stack height of 40
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m, special attention should be paid to the following points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following procedure is proposed for estimating the particle number:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, you need some receptor points which are located in the plume
 direction of the first dispersion situations.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Copy the file meteopgt.all and edit the original file.

 You will find the estimated statistical uncertainty for each receptor point
 in the file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

.
 The error should be below 20
\begin_inset space ~

% even after the calculation of only a few situations.
 If you like to analyze the concentration in certain weather conditions,
 the uncertainty (for a plume direction towards the receptor point) should
 be below 5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

%.
 If a receptor point lies within the plume direction and the error value
 is NA or above 25
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

%, the number of particles should be increased.
 Once the uncertainties are low enough, replace the meteogt.all file with
 the previously created copy and start the final calculation.

 like in the steady state mode.
 Afterwards replace the mettimeseries.dat file with the previously created

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the transient mode, the grid size of the concentration grid should
 not exceed 25x25

m², because otherwise very high concentrations of the transient particles
 and thus additional numerical uncertainties will occur, especially when
 calculationg the dispersion of very high stack sources (above 80

 This is somewhat contradictory to the fact that large concentration grids
 should be used for high stack sources.
 If necessary, a higher particle number must be used in such cases.

Effect of air being sucked in by the tunnel entrance of the opposite lane

 portal of the opposite lane.
 In GRAL it is recommended to define an area around tunnel portals were
 traffic enters a tunnel, to take this effect into account.
 Normally such areas are not very large (see example in Figure
